STANDARD NOTICE:  You are expected to stand this duty, or take responsibility for getting it covered.

   -  If you need coverage, OscarTRACK may be able to help, as follows:
      1. Log into OscarTRACK:
            http://<host_domain_name/>/<application_name/>
      2. Select the "Schedule" tab.
      3. Select the "Watchbill assistant" tab.
      4. Select the "Watchbill" tab.
      5. Set the Depth filter to "Not selected".
      6. Scroll to <nominal_day/>.
      7. Make a note of the members listed on the <shift_name/> of
         <nominal_day/>.  These members originally said they would be
         available for duty, but were not assigned for this shift.  If
         their certification and driving status would make them suitable
         replacements for you, try proposing a swap with them first, or
         asking them to cover your shift second.  You may be able to
         find contact information for them as follows:
         a. Select the "Personnel" tab.
         b. Check the "Phone list" checkbox.
         c. Scroll to the person's name to find their phone number, or..
         d. Click the yellow "open folder" icon to the left of their
            name to bring up a page that shows their email address.

   -  If the above process doesn't help, contact other members.  One-on-
      one contacts -- especially in person or by phone -- are usually
      much more effective than broadcast requests.

   -  If you legitimately can not meet the above expectations, click
      the following link to email your request for emergency leave to
      the appropriate stakeholders.  You should also call your chain-
      of-command superior as soon as possible:
