Receipt for donation to KVRS
Dear <donor_name/>,

(This is a form letter response.)

The Kempsville Volunteer Rescue Squad (KVRS) has received the $<amount_donated/> donation you made via PayPal on <donation_date/>.  Thank you!

- We did not receive enough information to attribute your
  donation to a particular household or business in our
  donation tracking system.  Although certainly not a
  requirement, if you would like your donation to be fully
  attributed in our tracking system, simply reply to this email
  (with this text included), and give us your street address.

- US taxpayers, your donation is tax deductible -- KVRS is a
  501.C.3 organization (public charity).

- If you made an In Memorium donation, KVRS will send an
  acknowledgement to the bereaved on your behalf.

- If you donated US$250 or more, KVRS will send a hardcopy
  acknowledgement later in the year to comply with IRS rules.

- KVRS wants to hear from you!  Please address your comments
  to the appropriate squad officer, as follows:

      president@kvrs.org

      treasurer@kvrs.org

      funddrive@kvrs.org

      captain@kvrs.org
