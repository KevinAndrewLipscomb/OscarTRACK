<actor/> (<actor_email_address/>) recently made the following change in <application_name/>:

   <first_name/> <last_name/> (<cad_num/>) has been approved to function
   in Virginia Beach as a(n):

      <medical_release_level/>

Therefore, an officer needs to change <first_name/>'s enrollment level.  Usually, personnel in this situation should be set to REGULAR enrollment, but other settings may apply.  The enrollment setting will affect how many shifts <first_name/> should run each month.

*** PLEASE LOG INTO <application_name/> NOW TO MAKE THIS CHANGE ***
