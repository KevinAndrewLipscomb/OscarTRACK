Monthly member status statement
<first_name/>,

This is an automatic statement from the Virginia Beach EMS <application_name/> system.  You are receiving this statement for a couple of reasons.

FIRST, it's very important that all your details be recorded correctly in <application_name/>.  The correctness of these details can prevent errors on next month's schedule, and can help the department forecast next month's staffing conditions properly.  In particular, you should double check the OBLIGED AMBULANCE SHIFTS number shown below.

Your status in <application_name/> for *next month* has been recorded as follows:

   Name:
      <first_name/> <last_name/>

   CAD # (Officer code):
      <cad_num/>

   Agency:
      <agency/>

   Section:
      <section_num/>

      Note:  Not all squads utilize sections.

   Medical release level:
      <medical_release_description/>

      Note 1:  This is the level at which you are released to perform
      patient care in Virginia Beach.

      Note 2:  If you are not released, you should be listed as a
      "Trainee" (if you have finished EMT-B class), "In Class" (if you
      are still in First Responder or EMT class), or "None" (if you have
      not yet started a First Responder or EMT class).

   Driver qualified:
      <be_driver_qualified/>

      Note:  You must have Defensive Driving and EVOC to be driver
      qualified.

   Enrollment level:
      <enrollment/>

      Note 1:  Only members with red or yellow ID cards should be listed
      as "Recruit".

      Note 2:  Standard enrollment levels for members with white ID
      cards who ride on ambulances include "Regular", "Life", and
      "Tenured".

      Note 3:  Liberal enrollment levels for members with white ID cards
      who ride on ambulances include "Associate", "Reduced (#)", and
      "Atypical".

      Note 4:  The following enrollment levels are reserved for members
      who do not ride on the ambulances:  "Applicant", "Admin",
      "SpecOps", and "Suspended".

   Length of service:
      <length_of_service/>

   Kind of leave:
      <kind_of_leave/>

   OBLIGED AMBULANCE SHIFTS:
      *<obliged_shifts/>*

      Note 1:  Unless otherwise advised by your squad commander or
      designee, you may stand more than your obliged number of ambulance
      shifts, and you are certainly encouraged to staff ambulances at
      unscheduled times.  OFF-DUTY MEMBERS DO NOT HAVE TO BE IN UNIFORM
      TO RESPOND TO AN ACTIVE CALL -- in fact this can be quite helpful
      to the system -- but you must be dressed with safety in mind, and
      you must wear your ID card.

      Note 2:  This value already takes into account your enrollment
      level and any leave that may have been granted to you.

      Note 3:  This number assumes 12 hour shifts.  Any arrangement
      approved by your squad commander that results in an equivalent
      number of hours is also acceptable.

      Note 4:  This value will be blank for members with "Atypical"
      enrollment.

Remember, the above details apply to *next month*.  If any of the above details are incorrect, notify your squad commander (or appropriate designee) *immediately*.

FINALLY, you must submit your availabilities to OSCAR by the 10th of the month.  The web address for availability submissions is:
