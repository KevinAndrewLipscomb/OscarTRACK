<application_name/> temp password
Someone (possibly you) at the host known as <client_host_name/> requested a new password for your <application_name/> account.  Your new temporary <application_name/> password is:

   <temporary_password/>

Once you log into <application_name/> with this new temporary password, <application_name/> will let you set a permanent password.

-- <application_name/> (http://<host_domain_name/>/<application_name/>)
