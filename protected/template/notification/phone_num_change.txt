Phone # change to <cad_num/> <last_name/>, <first_name/>
This is an automatic notification from <application_name/>.

<actor/> has changed the phone number for <agency_name/> member <first_name/> <last_name/> (<cad_num/>) to:

   <phone_num/>

NOTE that this action also *clears* <first_name/>'s Cellular Provider in <application_name/>, thus preventing <first_name/> from receiving any OSCALERTs via cellphone.  To re-enable <first_name/>'s OSCALERTs, <first_name/> must do the following:

1. Log into <application_name/>.
2. Click the "profile" link near the upper left corner.
3. Pick a Cellular Provider in the OSCALERT section.
4. Click the "Save OSCALERT settings" button.
