SQD CMDR ACTION REQ'D for <cad_num/> <last_name/>, <first_name/>
This is an automatic notification from <application_name/>.

~~~
~~~ ACTION REQUIRED
~~~

<actor/> (<actor_email_address/>) recently made the following change in <application_name/>:

   <first_name/> <last_name/> (<cad_num/>) has been approved to function
   in Virginia Beach as a(n):

      <medical_release_level/>

<application_name/> detected this change and automatically set <first_name/>'s enrollment level to "New trainee".

<first_name/>'s squad commander needs to change <first_name/>'s enrollment level.  Usually, personnel in this situation should immediately be set to REGULAR enrollment, but other settings may apply.  The enrollment setting will affect how many shifts <first_name/> should run each month.

Failure to take action on this may deprive <first_name/> <last_name/> of shifts needed to achieve release.

~~~
~~~ PLEASE LOG INTO <application_name/> NOW TO MAKE THIS CHANGE
~~~
