Monthly member status statement
<first_name/>,

This is an automatic statement from the Virginia Beach EMS <application_name/> system.  You are receiving this statement for a couple of reasons.

FIRST, it's very important that all your details be recorded correctly in <application_name/>.  The correctness of these details can prevent errors on next month's schedule, and can help the department forecast next month's staffing conditions properly.  In particular, you should double check the REQUIRED DUTIES number shown below.

Your status in <application_name/> for *next month* has been recorded as follows:

   Name:
      <first_name/> <last_name/>

   CAD # (Officer code):
      <cad_num/>

   Agency:
      <agency/>

   Section:
      <section_num/>

      Note:  Not all squads utilize sections.

   Primary phone number:
      <phone_num/>

   Released cert level:
      <medical_release_description/>

      Note 1:  This is the level at which you are released to perform
      patient care in Virginia Beach.

      Note 2:  If you are riding the ambulance while still attending EMT
      class, you should be listed as an "EMT Intern".  If you are
      certified but not released as an AIC, you should be listed as a
      "Trainee".

   Fully released to drive ambulances:
      <be_driver_qualified/>

   Membership status:
      <enrollment/>

      Note 1:  Members with red or yellow ID cards should be listed as
      "Recruit".

      Note 2:  Standard membership statuses for members with orange or
      white ID cards who ride on ambulances include "Regular", "Life",
      and "Tenured".

      Note 3:  Liberal membership statuses for members with orange or
      white ID cards who ride on ambulances include "Associate",
      "Reduced (#)", and "Atypical".

      Note 4:  The following membership statuses are reserved for
      members who do not ride on the ambulances:  "Applicant", "Admin",
      "SpecOps", and "Suspended".

   Length of service:
      <length_of_service/>

   Kind of leave:
      <kind_of_leave/>

   REQUIRED DUTIES:
      *<obliged_shifts/>*

      Note 1:  Unless otherwise advised by your squad commander or
      designee, you may stand more than your obliged number of ambulance
      shifts, and you are certainly encouraged to staff ambulances at
      unscheduled times.  OFF-DUTY MEMBERS DO NOT HAVE TO BE IN UNIFORM
      TO RESPOND TO AN ACTIVE CALL -- in fact this can be quite helpful
      to the system -- but you must be dressed with safety in mind, and
      you must wear your ID card.

      Note 2:  This value already takes into account your membership
      status and any leave that may have been granted to you.

      Note 3:  This number assumes 12 hour shifts.  Any arrangement
      approved by your squad commander that results in an equivalent
      number of hours is also acceptable.

      Note 4:  This value will be blank for members with "Atypical"
      membership status.

Remember, the above details apply to *next month*.  If any of the above details are incorrect, notify your squad commander (or appropriate designee) *immediately*.

FINALLY, personnel with required ambulance duties must submit availabilities to <application_name/> by the 10th of the month.  The web address for availability submissions is:

    http://<host_domain_name/>/<application_name/>

Thanks for your continued service to Virginia Beach EMS!
