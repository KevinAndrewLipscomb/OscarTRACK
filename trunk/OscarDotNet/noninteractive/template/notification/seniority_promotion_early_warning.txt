Seniority promotion imminent (<cad_num/> <last_name/>, <first_name/>)
This is an automatic notification from <application_name/>.

<application_name/> is forecast to automatically give <current_level/> member <first_name/> <last_name/> a seniority promotion one month from now.  Any change to <first_name/>'s duty requirements would take effect *two* scheduling cycles from now.

Any stakeholder wishing to DELAY such promotion should give advance notice to <first_name/>, cite the rationale for delaying the promotion, and address <first_name/>'s concerns, if any.  You can contact <first_name/> as follows:

   Email address:
      <subject_email_address/>

   Phone #:
      <subject_phone_number/>

If still necessary after following the above procedure, sufficiently privileged users may use <application_name/> WITHIN THE NEXT MONTH to delay the promotion as follows:

1. Go to the Personnel tab.
2. Open <first_name/>'s detail record.
3. Click the edit (little red pencil) icon next to the "Years of service" value.
4. Follow the instructions on the adjust_length_of_service form.
